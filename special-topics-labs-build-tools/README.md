# Special Topics Build Tools Lab

## Objective

For this lab, you will learn a little more about Maven and Gradle, by converting a Maven project to a Gradle project.  The project itself is pretty simple, but has been constructed to demonstrate some common use cases where build tools can help you accomplish your goal.  The code maps strings from "Upper Underscore" case to "Lower Camel" case, leveraging the [Guava CaseFormat](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/StringsExplained#caseformat) library.  The final artifact is a docker image that can be run and accepts an input string, converts it, and spits the output to `stdout`.

Please read through the entire lab before getting started, and review the [pom.xml](pom.xml) with its comments showing where maven is helping out during the build.

_NOTE:_ For this lab you will want to perform your builds only using a command line terminal.  The integration tests for this project are fairly complex, and require that the docker image be built (which happens as part of the `package` phase, when building with Maven) for them to run successfully.  

## Getting Started:

1. Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account using [these instructions](https://github.com/jschmersal-cscc/lab0-completing-and-submitting-assignments) substituting this repository URL ``https://github.com/jschmersal-cscc/special-topics-labs-build-tools`` for the one referenced in that document.  When adding a collaborator, be sure to add me ("jschmersal-cscc").
2. Create a new branch for your code changes as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/jschmersal-cscc/lab0-completing-and-submitting-assignments#important-before-you-start-coding)


## Completing the Assignment

1. The goal of this assignment is to migrate the existing Maven build infrastructure for this project to use Gradle instead.
    1. You _should_ be able to complete this assignment without having to change anything besides build scripts (but you are allowed to change other code if it makes your job easier).  Your finished project should not have a `pom.xml` file, and instead should have (at least) a `build.gradle` build script in its place.  When you are finished, you should be able to run `gradle build` and have your code compiled, unit tests executed, the docker image built, and your integration tests run successfully.
    1. You _must not_ remove or change any of the tests in the [src/test](src/test) directory.  If you want to add extra tests, by all means do so.  Remember though that the point of this lab isn't to fix or modify the software, but rather to migrate from one build system to another.  You might find it helpful to separate your integration and unit tests in a different manner for gradle builds than for maven builds (for example, putting them in separate source directories - see the Hints below).  That is fine as you're not actually modifying the tests.
    1. As you are migrating, you will notice a few things that Maven is handling for you (that will be critical parts of migrating to Gradle):
        1.  The first thing Maven is doing is helping manage dependencies.  If you look at the [pom.xml](pom.xml) you will see the `<dependencies>` section.  The inclusion of Guava is part of that.  If you were to [comment out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2757396/how-do-i-comment-out-a-block-of-tags-in-xml) the Guava dependency (I suggest you try it) and run `mvn clean compile` you will see that the code doesn't even compile.  Your first step in migrating to Gradle should likely be to get your code to compile with your Gradle build script.  
        1.  The second thing Maven is doing is helping run unit tests. If you run `mvn test` you will see output similar to the [this output](#mvn-test-output).  Your next step should be to get your tests running in your Gradle build.
        1.  Another thing Maven is doing is building a so-called executable ["Uber" or "Fat" jar](https://dzone.com/articles/the-skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber), using the Maven Assembly plugin (again, reference the [pom.xml](pom.xml)).  This helps application developers in two ways:
            1. When you have multiple dependent jars, sometimes classpath management and application distribution can be problematic.  For someone to use your library they need access to your maven metadata to know what to download (or you need to publish that list), and they need to set the [Java classpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java)) to include all of the jars necessary to run your application.  Java has some packaging formats to help with this, but they are somewhat niche usecases.  The assembly plugin has a goal that will take your application code and all of its dependencies, and shove them into a single jar file (this is what I'm referring to as an "Uber" or "Fat" jar).   
            1. Another problem with running java programs sometimes is getting the command right to actually start your program from the command line.  Java has [a facility](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html) to simplify the process for end users so they can just run your jar with a simple invocation (`java -jar <your-jar>.jar`).  The assembly plugin helps facilitate making your jar executable by letting you specify in your plugin configuration the class that contains your `main()` method you want as the entry point to your application. 
        1. Your next step should be augment your gradle build to get your jar built as an "uber" jar that is executable using `java -jar`.  You can easily test if this is working by running `java -jar <your-gradle-built-jar>.jar DOES_THIS_WORK` from the command line (expected output would be "doesThisWork").  The easiest way to do this is likely to follow the instructions [from this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278063/how-do-i-create-an-executable-fat-jar-with-gradle-with-implementation-dependenci).
        1. Maven is also useful in this case for building a docker image to make running our application portable.  When you look in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) you will see references to the `docker-maven-plugin`.  The `docker-maven-plugin` builds the docker image using the specified [Dockerfile](src/main/docker/Dockerfile) along with the artifact produced by the build (`constant-to-camel-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`).  You'll want to enhance your Gradle build to do the same.
        1. Finally, Maven is helping us run the integration tests with the `maven-failsafe-plugin`.  You should add this functionality to your gradle build script.  When the integration tests pass, you're done! 


## Hints
1. By default, gradle will execute anything under `src/test` in the unit test phase.  In maven, your integration tests and unit tests are both in `src/test` (and differentiated by test naming convention) so if you do nothing gradle will try to run your integration tests too early.  Probably the first thing you should do is move the integration tests to a separate directory (I suggest `src/integrationTest`) to let you get through compile and unit test more quickly.
1. Gradle tries to be helpful by skipping/aggregating lots of logging by default.  This is not helpful when you're trying to learn gradle's build lifecycle.  You can get more verbose logging by passing the `-i` (info) or `-v` (verbose) flags.  For example, `gradle clean build -i`.
1. While you can invoke individual phases of the [Maven Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) or individual tasks in the [Gradle Lifecycle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html), most people just run `mvn install` or `gradle build`, which encompasses everything you need to do.
1. You should be sure to [remove your docker images](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes) when you're at the stage you want to build the docker image using gradle, so you'don't accidentally confuse yourself by using your maven-produced image.
1. There is lots of good information on the internet, including Gradle's web site.  I encourage you to get familiar with Gradle tooling by trying out various tutorials (in particular you might find this one helpfule: https://guides.gradle.org/building-java-libraries/).  Please don't use an auto-conversion tool (if you find one that works).  Using `gradle init` in the directory your pom.xml is in should be fine (it bootstraps your build - please inspect what it did and see how it translated parts of the maven `pom.xml` to the `build.gradle`).  The goal here is for you to learn something.
1. There are plenty of Gradle plugins available.  You'll want to look through a few for your use cases (e.g. interacting with Docker).  I'd suggest to use something that seems pretty straightforward and has good examples documented.  For the "uber jar" (sometimes called a "fat jar") you can decide if you want to use a plugin or just use the built-in jar task, [with appropriate configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278063/how-do-i-create-an-executable-fat-jar-with-gradle-with-implementation-dependenci).
1. Docker plugins in Gradle are a bit of a mixed bag.  In particular, the palantir Grade Docker plugin doesn't seem to work in our environment.  I'd suggest you use the [Docker Gradle Plugin by bmuschko](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/).  If you'd like inspiration, look at this blog post: https://dzone.com/articles/build-docker-images-with-maven-and-gradle.  Unfortunately, that blog post is slightly out of date, so there are a couple changes you might need to make to adapt to the current plugin usage:
    1. The way to apply plugins is cleaner in newer Gradle versions.  It's easier to use a `plugins` block as shown in [Section 1.5.2. Applying the Plugin Using the Plugin DSL](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/).  Be sure to use a more recent plugin version than that blog post.
    1. You may safely ignore the stuff about Docker sockets and environment variables.  That must have been fixed since that blog post.
    1. Much of the value of the post is seeing how to structure a task that builds a docker image.  Note how it uses `dependsOn` to force an order of execution of your custom tasks (interleaved with built-in Gradle lifecycle tasks).  You want to be sure that running `gradle build` will execute all of your tasks in order (compile, unit test, package the jar, build the docker image, run the integration test).
    1. Some context around building docker images might help you here.  When you build a docker image, your [Dockerfile](src/main/docker/Dockerfile) specifies a list of commands to be run when building the image.  You can look at all of the commands in the [Docker reference for Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), but the one you'll most have to support is the [ADD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) command. The `ADD` command adds files from a "local" buid context into the image.  So you will need to make sure that your jar is available to the docker build context.  The build context is essentially a directory.  The bmuschko Docker Gradle Plugin specifies its build context in the `inputDir` field, which defaults to `build/docker`.  So you have two choices:
        1.  Make sure `build/docker` has everything you want to add (`src/main/docker/Dockerfile` and your jar) by the time you run the bmuschko plugin.
        1.  Change the inputDir to be something that already contains those files somewhere under them (for instance, `'.'` represents the base directory of your gradle project).
1. The place you're most likely to change a non-build script is when you're building your `Dockerfile`.  The existing [Dockerfile](src/main/docker/Dockerfile) has the jar name explicitly coded, and depending on how you do things your gradle-produced artifact might not follow the same naming conventions.  If they don't match, you'll likely see something along the lines of this when you try to run your docker:
```Error: Unable to access jarfile /opt/constant-to-camel-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar```
1. Running integration tests is a bit of a "roll your own" in Gradle, unfortunately.  There is, however, some collective common wisdom to be had.  The usual pattern is:
    1. Separate unit test source code from integration test code.  This is frequently done by putting them in separate directories (e.g. `src/test` and `src/integrationTest`) and is a solid choice.
    1. However you separate your tests, you need to tell Gradle where to find your integration test source code and its dependencies.  [This blog post](https://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/gradle/getting-started-with-gradle-integration-testing/) does a pretty good job of explaining why and how to do so.
    1. Ensure your integration tests run at the right time (similar to the prior hints on ordering, `dependsOn` will be useful heare). 
1. If you want to test things, run your image with `docker run <your-image-name>:<your-image-tag>`.  The default output you should see is `thisIsATestConstantName`.
1. Finally, seeing your output can be challenging for Gradle newcomers.  The best advice is probably to run with the `-i` flag while you're getting used to things.  Regardless, [enabling verbose test output](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40954017/gradle-how-to-get-output-from-test-stderr-stdout-into-console) is likely also a good idea.
